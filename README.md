### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a second-year graduate student (expected to graduate in 2025) at HIT@SCIR, advised by Prof. Wanxiang Che.

- âœ¨ Previously, my main research interests focused on deep learning for natural language generation (NLG), e.g., grammatical error correction.

- ðŸš€ Recently, my main research interest has been in the study of efficient inference for large language models, in particular speculative decoding.
